# Data Science Internship at Cognifyz Technologies - Level 2

## Overview

This repository contains the work completed for Level 2 of my Data Science internship at Cognifyz Technologies. The tasks focused on advanced data analysis, feature engineering, and visualizations.

## Task 1: Table Booking and Online Delivery

1. **Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer table booking and online delivery.**
2. **Compare the average ratings of restaurants with table booking and those without.**
3. **Analyze the availability of online delivery among restaurants with different price ranges.**

### Steps:
- Calculated the percentage of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery.
- Compared average ratings using bar charts to visualize differences between restaurants with and without table booking.
- Analyzed online delivery availability across different price ranges and visualized the findings.

## Task 2: Price Range Analysis

1. **Determine the most common price range among all the restaurants.**
2. **Calculate the average rating for each price range.**
3. **Identify the color that represents the highest average rating among different price ranges.**

### Steps:
- Identified the most common price range by analyzing frequency distribution.
- Calculated and visualized average ratings for each price range using bar charts.
- Highlighted the price range with the highest average rating and its corresponding color representation.

## Task 3: Feature Engineering

1. **Extract additional features from the existing columns, such as the length of the restaurant name or address.**
2. **Create new features like "Has Table Booking" or "Has Online Delivery" by encoding categorical variables.**

### Steps:
- Created new features based on the length of restaurant names and addresses.
- Encoded categorical variables to create binary features indicating the presence of table booking and online delivery options.

## Conclusion

This level of the internship provided hands-on experience in advanced data analysis, feature engineering, and creating insightful visualizations. The skills and techniques learned here will be invaluable for more complex data science projects.
