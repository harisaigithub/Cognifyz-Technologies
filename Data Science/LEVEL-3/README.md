# Data Science Internship at Cognifyz Technologies - Level 3

## Overview

This repository contains the work completed for Level 3 of my Data Science internship at Cognifyz Technologies. The tasks focused on predictive modeling, customer preference analysis, and data visualization.

## Task 1: Predictive Modeling

1. **Build a Regression Model**
   - Developed models to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on various features.
   - Explored different algorithms including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation.

2. **Evaluate Model Performance**
   - Assessed model performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Compared the performance of different algorithms to identify the best model.

## Task 2: Customer Preference Analysis

1. **Cuisine and Rating Relationship**
   - Analyzed the relationship between the type of cuisine and the restaurant's rating.
   - Identified the most popular cuisines based on the number of votes.
   - Determined specific cuisines that tend to receive higher ratings.

## Task 3: Data Visualization

1. **Distribution of Ratings**
   - Created histograms, bar plots, and other visualizations to represent the distribution of ratings.

2. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Compared average ratings of different cuisines and cities using visualizations.

3. **Feature Relationships**
   - Visualized the relationship between various features (e.g., price, location) and the target variable (rating) to gain insights.
