# Data Science Internship at Cognifyz Technologies 🎉

I am thrilled to announce that I've successfully completed my Data Science internship at Cognifyz Technologies! 🚀

## Overview

Throughout this internship, I had the opportunity to delve into various tasks and projects that enhanced my skills and knowledge in data science.

## Levels and Tasks

### Level 1

#### 📊 Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Explored datasets to identify rows and columns.
- Checked for missing values and handled them accordingly.
- Performed data type conversions if necessary.
- Analyzed the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate rating") and identified any class imbalances.

#### 📈 Descriptive Analysis
- Calculated basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.
- Explored the distribution of categorical variables like "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines."
- Identified the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.

#### 🌍 Geospatial Analysis
- Visualized restaurant locations on a map using latitude and longitude information.
- Analyzed the distribution of restaurants across different cities or countries.
- Determined correlations between a restaurant's location and its rating.

### Level 2

#### 🧾 Table Booking and Online Delivery
- Determined the percentage of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery.
- Compared the average ratings of restaurants with and without table booking.
- Analyzed the availability of online delivery among different price ranges.

#### 💵 Price Range Analysis
- Identified the most common price range among all restaurants.
- Calculated the average rating for each price range.
- Identified the color representing the highest average rating among different price ranges.

#### 🔧 Feature Engineering
- Extracted additional features from existing columns, such as the length of restaurant names or addresses.
- Created new features like "Has Table Booking" or "Has Online Delivery" by encoding categorical variables.

### Level 3

#### 🔮 Predictive Modeling
- Built a regression model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on available features.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets and evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Experimented with different algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, and random forest to compare performance.

#### 🍽️ Customer Preference Analysis
- Analyzed the relationship between the type of cuisine and restaurant ratings.
- Identified the most popular cuisines based on the number of votes.
- Determined if any specific cuisines tend to receive higher ratings.

#### 📊 Data Visualization
- Created visualizations to represent the distribution of ratings using different charts (histogram, bar plot, etc.).
- Compared the average ratings of different cuisines or cities using appropriate visualizations.
- Visualized the relationship between various features and the target variable to gain insights.
