Level 1
Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Explore the dataset and identify the number of rows and columns.
- Check for missing values in each column and handle them accordingly.
- Perform data type conversion if necessary.
- Analyze the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate rating") and identify any class imbalances.

Task 2: Descriptive Analysis
- Calculate basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.
- Explore the distribution of categorical variables like "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines."
- Identify the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.

Task 3: Geospatial Analysis
- Visualize the locations of restaurants on a map using latitude and longitude information.
- Analyze the distribution of restaurants across different cities or countries.
- Determine if there is any correlation between the restaurant's location and its rating.


# Data Science Internship at Cognifyz Technologies - Level 1

## Overview

This repository contains the work completed for Level 1 of my Data Science internship at Cognifyz Technologies. The tasks focused on data exploration, descriptive analysis, and geospatial analysis.

## Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing

1. **Explore the dataset and identify the number of rows and columns.**
2. **Check for missing values in each column and handle them accordingly.**
3. **Perform data type conversion if necessary.**
4. **Analyze the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate rating") and identify any class imbalances.**

### Steps:
- Loaded the dataset and inspected the first few rows to understand its structure.
- Used descriptive statistics and visualization techniques to identify missing values and handled them by imputation or removal.
- Converted data types where necessary to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- Analyzed the distribution of the target variable to check for class imbalances.

## Task 2: Descriptive Analysis

1. **Calculate basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.**
2. **Explore the distribution of categorical variables like "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines."**
3. **Identify the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.**

### Steps:
- Calculated statistical measures for numerical data to understand central tendencies and variability.
- Visualized the distribution of categorical variables using bar charts and pie charts.
- Identified top cuisines and cities with the highest restaurant count using grouping and aggregation techniques.

## Task 3: Geospatial Analysis

1. **Visualize the locations of restaurants on a map using latitude and longitude information.**
2. **Analyze the distribution of restaurants across different cities or countries.**
3. **Determine if there is any correlation between the restaurant's location and its rating.**

### Steps:
- Plotted restaurant locations on a map using latitude and longitude coordinates.
- Analyzed the spatial distribution of restaurants across various regions to identify patterns and trends.
- Investigated the relationship between geographic location and restaurant ratings to uncover potential correlations.

## Conclusion

This level of the internship provided a solid foundation in data exploration, descriptive analysis, and geospatial analysis. The skills and techniques learned here will be invaluable for more advanced data science projects.
